# Cracking The Coding Interview Again
Journey From Being Laid Off From First Software Development Job To The Next One.

Laid Off - 13 January 2023, Blueoptima Fired 122 employees.

First Week- Did Finish Resume, got it reviewed by a few friends and my sister, restarted coding from blind 75 questions, got a few calls from cricbuzz and fynds recruiters. Staying strong ;)

Second Week- So this week went in mostly travel, I got my grads degree this week, so my parents and all the old college homies came by hence it was a bit chill time, I missed like an interview or so.

Third Week- This week started with a bang again with 4 interviews in 3 days, it was right on target, I gained the lost interview confidence, Lets go kill more interviews.

Update 3rd Week, Got selected for first job at eunimart, Hyderabad India ;)

Week 4- Gave Interview Round 1 for Amazon, and also got a revert from FalconBrik, preparing for the next Founders round.
